NEED TO DO GLOBAL VARIABLE FOR CATEGORY TO AVOID CHANGE MANY PLACES IN THE CODE WHEN WE ADD OR REMOVE CATEGORIES FILTER

FILTER FEATURE : make that on load no filter selected but all spots displayed and as soon as one filter get triggered start triggering
maybe have one state : filterMode ?
and conditional logic of render of spot check if filter is on or off and if on he does filter etc and if off display all


issue on valid client side category check the "&&"
if i unclick and click again initial value formik it does not work i need to click twice
