FORMIK find a way to use Field etc episode 8
--> maybe have a big component <Form/> where formik leaves and he only send to parent the data for submissioN ?





validation asynchrone adresse email & utilisateur + meme nom de form :

implement for edit form



Current caveats:  

For both EDIT and NEW I have : 
one comp EditSpotForm and one CheckboxItemEDIT

- When adding an icon for category, need to duplciate it for new & edit 
first do new then do edit and when do edit need to add 
intialCheckbox props
change some names
DRY rule broken between checkboc item EDIT and checkbotitemNEW
